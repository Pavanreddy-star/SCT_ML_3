# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Classifier using SVM

This project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on the Kaggle **Dogs vs. Cats dataset** using **HOG feature extraction** for improved accuracy.

## 🚀 Features
- **Uses HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** for feature extraction.
- **SVM with RBF kernel** for better classification.
- **Hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearchCV.
- **Trains on grayscale images resized to 128x128 pixels**.
- **Achieves ~70-80% accuracy** with optimized parameters.
